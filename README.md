# A-Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones
In this project, I will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). I will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.
This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan.
